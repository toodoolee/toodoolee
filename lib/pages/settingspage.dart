                so we had to set reminders for both of the every group. 
                so we are doing - 
                
                if reminder has PM, then Remove PM from the game, whatever left set that as the reminder. 
                If reminder has AM in it, then Remove AM from the game, whatever left set that as the reminder. 
                The errors preceds for this group,
                Suppose one of the hero, woke up at 6:00 and set the reminder of "Create Quadcopter üöÅ at 8 pm", 
                then the Notification can set Reminders for 8:00 am and won't ring at 8:00 night! 
                (Grave errrrror Right).
                That's they are using something, 
                1. Remove the PM/AM
                2. Converts whatever number they have to 24 hours clock.
                In this way it is efficient and more reliable.
                This process is done by the Function, getReminderTime().
                which is in the last line of the setNotifications.dart
                BTW,
                and if reminder has nothing, i.e PM/AM then, this is clear person has set reminder from 24 hours clock.
                So setting remianders in this case is easy as eatin Eat Watermelons.
                
                For more Info, Check getReminderTime() method, which is in the last line of the Notification/setNotification.dart

This is a simple introduction of most simplest app, 
Toodoolee Toodoolee wants to revolutionarize the whole Toodo App World, 
There are Pretty much lot of apps in this world,
but Toodoolee is certainly not among them,
it focuses on Limited-ness and focuses on writing up most important Toodos for the Day.
People tend to write really unrelated things like,
Bathing,
Sleeping,
etc. for the whole day, 
which is really really unproductive,
Toodoolee focuses for you maximally limited things,
because, when the days are limited why are not your works?
Toodooleee is a revolt Against All Tooodo apps,
Because they worsen your creatvity and productivitiness.
To Sustain it, 
To make a change for the people around us,
the people who leave their world who wanted to do world changing something but didn't able to do,
ones who were crazy for their dreams.
As a Human what we can't do together, (from starting, Hunting, Gathering and now biggest World Innovations like Toodoolee)
So, If you can contribute to the upcomming generations, most happiliy contribute what you have abundant-ly (me = grateful)
Tap and Give the Coooofffee to all of them, who made possible this Toodoolee and doing unlimited efforts to sustain it.
Wake them up with the coffee, so they never sleep, and make the best of Toodoolee. (amen)
