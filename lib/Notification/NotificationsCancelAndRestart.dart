We are doing +100. because,
if there can be another reminder notification which can have 4 as an ID, 
+100 can create a whole new different Notification ID so no other notification gets cancel, if we are cenlling another notification.

here hour and minute is added for the ID
so ID = 4 + 0 + 100 = 104 is ID
so 104 is ID, so the ID is what we have, now we can delete any streak by this ID.
