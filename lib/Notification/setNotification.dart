/* One Most beautiful and elegant thing, that seriously reduces a good amount of code.

This method senses the whatever String or more specifically time,
and gives the outputs as according to them.

Like if the Reminder has PM keyword in it. then it will change PM to 24-hour clock timings like 7:00 pm is 19:00
If the Reminder has AM in it, let there be no change, except removing the AM keyword like how we were removing in PM.
If the Reminder is 24 hours. then no need to make good changes.
